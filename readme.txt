Integrate WooCommerce with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) DataLayer for advanced tracking and IRR to USD conversion.

== Description ==
Custom Datalayer Woo is a plugin designed to seamlessly integrate WooCommerce with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) DataLayer. It allows you to track key eCommerce events such as:
- Add to Cart
- Begin Checkout
- Purchases
- Viewing Product and Category Pages

### Key Features:
- Automatically converts store currency from IRR (Rial) to USD when sending data to GA4, ensuring compatibility with Google Analytics' reporting format.
- Tracks customer behavior and traffic sources.
- Fully compatible with GA4's eCommerce schema, enabling detailed reports on items, categories, and customer interactions.
- Supports advanced category tracking, including primary, secondary, and tertiary categories.

### How It Works:
If your WooCommerce store is configured to use IRR (Rial) or Toman as the currency, the plugin automatically converts all transaction values to USD before sending them to Google Analytics. This ensures accurate analytics and eliminates compatibility issues with GA4, which does not support IRR directly.

### Usage:
1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Ensure your WooCommerce store is configured with IRR or Toman as the currency.
3. Visit your Google Analytics dashboard to see real-time eCommerce tracking and accurate currency conversion.
